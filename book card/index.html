            <p>Introduction
                Computer programmers and software developers often use a tool called an array to manage large datasets
                efficiently. Arrays help sort and identify variables, making them essential for handling complex data.
                Learning about arrays can improve your understanding of software development or help you use them in
                your own projects.

                <b>What is an Array?</b>
                <br>
                An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the
                simplest data structure where each data element can be accessed directly by only using its index number.

                <b>Need of using Array:</b><br>
                In programming, most of the cases need to store a large amount of data of a similar type. We need to
                define numerous variables to store such a huge amount of data. While writing the programs, it would be
                very tough to memorize all variable names. Instead, it is better to define an array and store all the
                elements in it.
